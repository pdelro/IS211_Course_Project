# IS211_Course_Project

The purpose of this web application is to give a user the ability to run their own blog. I created a homepage which displays the blog entries.  On the top right is a link to the login page.  After entering the correct username and password, you will be redirected to the dashboard.  The dashboard is similar to the homepage, except edit and delete buttons have been added for each entry as well as a link to add a post. I modelled this project based on Assignment 12.
